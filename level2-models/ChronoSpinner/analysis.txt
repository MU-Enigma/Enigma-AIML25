
Model Performance Comparison
============================

Accuracy:
- Linear Regression: 0.99
- Perceptron: 0.99

Time to Convergence:
- Linear Regression: 0.0122 seconds
- Perceptron: 2.9198 seconds

Average Time per Prediction:
- Linear Regression: 0.000000 seconds
- Perceptron: 0.000000 seconds

Observations:
- Both models achieved high accuracy (~99.00), indicating the dataset might be linearly separable.
- The time to convergence varies based on the dataset and the model's complexity.
- Typically, the perceptron converges faster on linearly separable data, whereas linear regression might take longer depending on learning rate.

Analysis:
Both the models giving same accuracy indicates that the dataset is linear.
Other datasets which arent linear will not work well with linear classification as they are work complex and not in a straight line form.
