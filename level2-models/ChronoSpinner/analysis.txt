
Model Performance Comparison
============================

Accuracy:
- Linear Regression: 0.99
- Perceptron: 0.99

Time to Convergence:
- Linear Regression: 0.0122 seconds
- Perceptron: 2.9198 seconds

Average Time per Prediction:
- Linear Regression: 0.000000 seconds
- Perceptron: 0.000000 seconds

Observations:
- Both models achieved high accuracy (~99.00), indicating the dataset might be linearly separable.
- The time to convergence varies based on the dataset and the model's complexity.
- Typically, the perceptron converges faster on linearly separable data, whereas linear regression might take longer depending on learning rate.
