Iterations                      993                  1000
Time per Prediction             2.29 micro sec              2.49 micro sec

KEY FINDINGS
------------
- Linear Regression wins with higher accuracy (87.17% vs 84.33%) and faster convergence
- The data is nearly linearly separable. Linear regression's MSE loss creates better decision boundaries than the perceptron's sample-wise updates
- Linear regression's batch gradient descent is more efficient than the perceptron's online learning rule
- Both models are equally fast for predictions, as they use the same linear prediction formula

CONCLUSION
----------
Linear Regression outperforms the Perceptron in both accuracy and convergence speed. The dataset's linear structure makes gradient descent-based optimization more effective than the perceptron approach.
