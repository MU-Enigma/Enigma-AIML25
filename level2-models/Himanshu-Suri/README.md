Results Analysis

inear Regression is an efficient, fast, simple, and surprisingly effective due to the linear dataset being better suited for linear regression. 

Perceptron while achieving reasonable accuracy may be better suited for online or adaptive learning tasks, but itâ€™s less efficient for static datasets.

For non-linear datasets, more complex models (kernelized SVMs or Neural Networks) would outperform both.
