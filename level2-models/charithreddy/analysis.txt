Level 2 Analysis - Charith Reddy
--------------------------------
Linear Regression Accuracy: 0.990
Linear Regression Train Time: 0.0098s
Linear Regression Prediction Time: 0.000002s

Perceptron Accuracy: 0.990
Perceptron Train Time: 4.5941s
Perceptron Prediction Time: 0.000050s

Observations:
- Linear Regression treats output as continuous, then thresholded for classification.
- Perceptron updates weights only for misclassified samples; better for discrete classes.
- Training time depends on number of features and epochs.
- Accuracy may differ depending on dataset separability.
